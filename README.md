# Craiyon Download Button
This extension adds a download button to the AI image creator site "craiyon.com" which allows you to download all the 9 generated images as separate image files in one go!

## How to Install

### Firefox
Just download it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/craiyon-download-all-images/.

### Chrome (or Brave, Vivaldii, Opera, etc.)
I haven't put it on the Chrome Web Store so far, as I'm hesitant to give Google my credit card info. (I only use my credit card for emergencies like getting John Wick out of trouble.)
Therefore, you have to manually install it as follows:
1. Download the newest version (the first zip file) from https://github.com/perguto/Craiyon-Download-Button/releases/.
2. Open "chrome://extensions", activate "developer mode" by toggling the switch in the upper right corner, click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.
